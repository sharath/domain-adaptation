# Domain Adapataion with GANs

Some experiments with domain adaptation using GANs.


## Notebooks

Self-contained prototyping code. Everything else is designed to run on [Gypsum](https://gypsum-docs.cs.umass.edu/).

## Generate to adapt

Implementation based on [1].

Usage:
```
python3 -m GTA <args>

```
